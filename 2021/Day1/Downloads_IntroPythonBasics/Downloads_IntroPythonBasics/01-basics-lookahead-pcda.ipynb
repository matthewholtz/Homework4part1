    "### About Jupyter notebooks\n",
    "This tutorial is a Jupyter notebook. It's a browser based interactive Python computing environment that allows you to mix markdown with executable Python code - yes, similar to R Markdown, but different. It's very easy to use but there are a ton of useful features that may not be apparent at first. For example, while code cells are used primarily for executing Python code, you can also do things like running Linux or Windows shell commands via something known as *magics*. We'll even learn how to run R commands from Juptyer notebooks using *rmagic*. Check out the [Jupyter notebook documentation](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) to learn how to be an efficient Jupyter notebook user. In addition, see Chapter 1 of our **Python Data Science Handbook** by Jake VanderPlas (PDSH by JVP for short). Learning a few of the following:\n",
